# Course Commit Log

This repo is a step-by-step commit log of all the changes the Lectuter makes in the Udemy course [Implement High Fedility Designs with Material-UI and ReactJS](https://www.udemy.com/share/102FSw3@HhMnIjr0GPsnedp8ZCgMxFK_v8akZ6RwCgLIR_SAkDe8EAqqztv2J1CFlSYackny/)

The reason I did this is mostly so I can easily reference the exact code changes I made at each increment.

Another reason and probably even more important reason, is that the course is done with the previous version of Material-UI (MUI 4 / @material-ui) and I wanted to learn the most current version (MUI 5 / @mui).

So I can then still do the course, adapt everyting to MUI 5 and then have my own Reference material in a detailed, highly incremental commit log.

## The commit log and navigating through it

I do way more commits than there are videos in the course. The videos obviously handle a full topic at a time, but many small and working steps are covered in each video. I try to do a commit with detailed comments below each commit to describe the steps and add relevant resources where applicable.

I took great effort to add these comment, so scroll to the bottom of each commit to see those and from there I also added handy (and rudementary) navigation links to navigate from any commit back to the previous or ahead to the next commit.

The Nav-links just make it much easier to move between commits, in-order, instead of going back to the commit log and trying to figure out what the last commit was I read.

If there is a better way to navigate between commits, please ... please let me know so I can spend that time a bit better ðŸ˜„

If you dicovered this commit log by chance I hope it helps, as it goes along with that course.

## The first commit is the last commit in the log

Here is a handy link to the [First Commit](https://github.com/monello/hifi-material-ui/commit/95af34f1197892e8516804fbfafb607d950e61fd), that is obviously the last commit on the last page of the log so a bit painful to get to otherwise
